            My name is Kelly, but I go by zigzag online. My company is tinyzigzag, <br>
            you can play a very short game I made at <a href="https://www.tinyzigzag.com" title="tinyzigzag.com">my website.</a>
            If it's not working, <br>come back in a little while, I've updated the game and will be posting <br>the updated version soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started teaching myself C# and JavaScript a little more than two years ago(yes, a covid hobby), in the interest of learning <br>
            how to create games. I mostly use Unity, but also know Phaser. I learned to create 3D models and animate them in <br>
            Blender, and how to create textures and sprites in GIMP, all to use in my games in Unity. <br>I love all of it!
            <br>
            <br>
            I decided that, next, I would do a coding bootcamp, in order to really polish my skills while also learning a new one, <br>
            creating websites! I really enjoy it so far. My ultimate goal, however, is to be a game developer. <br>
            I'm even currently employed part-time creating an app of games! 
            <br>
            <br>
            Aside from creating games, I also love cats! Here is one of mine! <!--add image of ziggy-->
            <br>
            <br>
            I can't think of anything else to say about myself, so I'll wrap this up. Don't forget to try out the game by <br>
            pressing the link that says "Game"! If it's not there yet, I haven't finished it yet, so check back in the next few days!
